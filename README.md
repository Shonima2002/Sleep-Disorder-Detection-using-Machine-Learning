# Sleep-Disorder-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

## Overview
This project aims to detect sleep disorders using machine learning techniques. By leveraging data on sleep patterns and associated health factors, the model classifies individuals into different sleep disorder categories, helping in early detection and intervention.

### Dataset
The dataset includes features related to sleep duration, quality, lifestyle habits, and physiological parameters. It is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.

## Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features for better model performance.
Model Selection: Implementing classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to measure performance.

## Results
The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics. The modelâ€™s predictions help in identifying individuals at risk of sleep disorders.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
